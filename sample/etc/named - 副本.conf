	 - If your recursive DNS server has a public IP address, you MUST enable access

 Views let a name server answer a DNS query differently depending on who is asking.

 By default, if named.conf contains no "view" clauses, all zones are in the 
 "default" view, which matches all clients.

 Views are processed sequentially. The first match is used so the last view should
 match "any" - it's fallback and the most restricted view.

 If named.conf contains any "view" clause, then all zones MUST be in a view.
