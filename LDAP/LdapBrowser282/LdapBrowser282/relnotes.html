LDAP Browser/Editor 2.8.2 Release Notes</h2></center>

<center>April 25th, 2001</center>

<h3>
What's New in Version 2.8.2</h3>
The LDAP Browser/Editor 2.8.2 is a maintenance release. It contains a number
of bug fixes and various improvements described below. It also contains
a couple of new features. For a complete list of changes see the <a href="CHANGES.TXT">changes.txt</a>
file included with the distribution.
<p><b>New Features/Improvements:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Multiple windows: Multiple windows/connections can be opened at the same
time without starting a separate JVM for each connection.</li>

<li>
Improved UTF8 support for various functions and operations.</li>

<li>
For authenticated connections, the password does not need to be stored
in the configuration file anymore. The Browser will prompt the user for
the password when needed.</li>

<li>
Improved configuration. Generic and static Browser settings are now pulled
and stored in a separate configuration file. See <a href="faq.html#What is the lbe.properties">What
is lbe.properties file?</a> question for details.</li>

<li>
PKCS12 support: The CA certificates, and client certificates can now be
loaded from the PKCS12 files. The files must have <i>.p12</i> extension
to be loaded in the PKCS12 format. This functionality relies on the JSSE
and its support for PKCS12 standard.</li>

<li>
Partial internationalization: This is an initial effort to internationalize
the entire code and translate it into a couple of languages. Right now
only a small portion of the code is internationalized and only Polish translation
is provided.</li>
</ol>
<b>Bug Fixes:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Backslash characters ('\') were not properly escaped in the session files.</li>

<li>
UTF8 encoded distinguished names were incorrectly encoded/decoded in ldap
urls.</li>
</ol>
<b>Current limitations/bugs:</b>
<ul>
<li>
LDIF changetypes are not supported.</li>

<li>
No schema integration.</li>

<li>
No VLV/Paged results support.</li>

<li>
Fetch DN only works with ldap v3 servers.</li>

<li>
Various window refresh problems - due to bugs in JVM.</li>
</ul>
<b>Other Notes:</b>
<p>If running the Browser with JVM 1.3 you might encounter some problems
with the JNDI library. JVM 1.3 includes an older version of the JNDI library
then the version that is distributed with the Browser. 1.3 will load the
older version instead of the Browser version. To force the Browser to load
its version of the JNDI library using the '<i>lbe</i>' script pass '<i>fix13</i>'
as the <b>first</b> parameter to the script. Examples: on <b>Windows </b>type:
<i>lbe.bat
fix13 </i>on<i> </i><b>Unix/Linux </b>type:<i> lbe.sh fix13.</i>
<p><b>Mac OS X:</b>
<p>The Browser was successfully tested on Mac OS X.
