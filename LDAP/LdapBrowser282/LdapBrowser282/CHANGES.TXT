Version 2.8.2 beta II
=====================

 - Enhancement: Partial internationalization of the code. Right now
                only hand full of components have been internationalized.
                Also, only (bad) Polish translation is provided.
 - Update: Urls passed during copy-and-paste, and DnD operations are now 
           UTF8 encoded.
 - Enhancement: Messages in the error log window can be easily copied to the 
                system clipboard.
 - Update: CA certificates and user certificates can now be loaded from 
           pkcs12 files also. Also the location and the password of the 
           ca certificates file can be modified from the lbe.properties file.
	   The location of the CA certificate file can also be specified as 
           an url.
 - Update: New configuration file stored in the .lbe/ directory under the 
           user's home directory. See details in FAQs.
 - Update: Session names can now be easily changed/edited in the session window
 - Bug fix: All \ were ignored from cfg files. Now they can be escaped with \
 - Update: Table sorting option can be now specified in the configuration file.
 - Update: Minor updates to the referral window. Only one click is now required
	   to connect anonymously to the server.
 - Enhancement: The status bar now displays what sort of binding was performed:
                user, anonymous, or other (external).
 - Enhancement: If binding as a user and the password is not specified the
                browser will now prompt the user for the password when
	        connecting. So the password does not have to be stored in a 
	        file.
 - Enhancement: Multiple ldap session windows - MDI application.
 - Update: Session list is now sortable. (and sorted by default)
 - Update: Renamed the browser.jar to lbe.jar
 - Update: Updated the 'lbe' scripts to use default java env.
 - Update and bug fix. LDIF importer can import base64 encoded dns and handles
                       :< LDIF directive. Also, LDIF Exported is able to 
		       export internationalized dns and attributes.
 - Enhancement: The applet now has an option of running inside of the browser
                or outside of the browser in a separate window. See the
	        'window' parameter in the doc.

Version 2.8.1
=============

 - Enhancement: Read thread was re-implemented to take read requests so a new
                thread does not need to be started each time a read command
	        is issued.
 - Enhancement: Seamless integration with SSL. No extra configuration is 
                required to connect over SSL.
 - Enhancement: Better debugging system: multiple levels and types of debugging
                information.
 - Bug fix: Updated the code to compile under JVM 1.3
 - Bug fix: The system clipboard was not accessible if ran as an application.
 - Bug fix: LDIF export incorrectly formatted string values and new line
            characters. 
 - Bug fix: Move operation would delete source entry even when the operation
            failed.
 - Bug fix: A template with the same attribute defined (in different cases)
            would break the browser while creating a new entry.
 - Update: Copy-and-paste will now work in unsigned applet but it will
           not use the system clipboard to transfer the data.
 - Update: Minor UI updates to various dialog boxes to be more consistent.
 - Enhancement: Append base DN to the User DN check box was added in the 
                connect window.
 - Enhancement: Pasting onto attributes from selected (copied) entry is now
                allowed. It DN or the URL of the source entry will be
	        added to the selected attribute. Useful e.g. for adding 
	        users to groups or creating referrals.
 - Update: Drag and drop interface. The type of operation defaults to the 
           system depended operation. For example, on Windows and Linux the
	   default operation is move (just when an object is dragged)
	   Also, the attribute table can now be drag onto. It will cause
	   an attribute to be updated with the dn or url of the source node.
 - Enhancement: added a new config option for specifying the ssl port number:
               (sslport)
 - Enhancement [experimental]: added config option for setting the 
                               sasl client mechanisms packages:
                               (javax.security.sasl.client.pkgs)
 - Enhancement [experimental]: added config option for setting the ldap
                               jndi provider: (jndi.provider)

Version 2.8 beta I
==================

 - Drag and Drop support
   o Nodes on the directory tree can be dragged to another location, within
     the browser or another instance of the browser.
   o Only works in Windows. Linux and Solaris are  not supported due to bugs
     in Java (except specific versions)
   
 - Copy and paste of dn trees and attributes
   o Tree nodes and/or attributes and their values can be copied into the
     clipboard and pasted into another instance of the browser. 
     Note: Trees cannot be 'cut' in-between two instances of the browser,
     only copied. Cut on trees is supported within a single instance of the 
     browser.
  
 - Added referral support to all ldap functions
   o Binding anonymously or with user credentials is supported. 
     Referrals will be ignored when removing or moving trees. 
     *** Not every function handles referrals correctly ***
  
 - Added password viewer
   o Displays passwords as strings
   o Can verify and generate SHA, MD5 and Unix crypt passwords

 - Edit mode updates
   o Double-click on attribute brings up edit window instead of view window
   o Deleting entries or attributes by pressing DELETE key on tree or table.
 
 - Search window, LDIF Import/Export improvements, Tree move/copy/rename
   o Executed as separate threads, can be canceled by pressing CANCEL
     button or by hitting ESCAPE key.
 
 - Preliminary applet support
   o The browser can be run as an applet, configuration and other files can be
     loaded from URLs. 
 
 - SSL support
   o The browser now supports secure ldap connections over the SSL protocol.
     Please read the SSL.txt document for more information.

 - Misc. updates
   o More configuration options such as security options, referral options,
     and alias options, etc. Some of them can also be set from the options
     panel in the connect window.
   o Ability to set custom leaf indicator attribute and its type. 
    e.g. numSubordinates in Netscape LDAP Server
   o Trees can be sorted quickly and automatically.
   o Attribute table was updated for faster updates.
   o Added toolbar with most frequent operations
   o Preliminary support for internalization and customization of the browser:
     (colors, menus, menu labels, look and feel can be customized through a 
     properties file)
  
THINGS ADDED BUT NOT TESTED:
  
1. Aliasing
   o Different options for dereferencing aliases were not tested.
  
LIMITATIONS:

1. Referrals hops
   o The browser does not keep track of referral hops at this point.
     Circular referrals might hang the browser.
 
BUGS:
 
1. In JDK 1.3, the attribute table background might not be painted
   correctly due to a Java bug.
2. Drag and drop might cause the browser to hang in some cases.
3. The browser does not correctly handle entries with multiple referral
   URLs.
